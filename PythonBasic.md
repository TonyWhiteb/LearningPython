# Python Basic

## Some Tips

Python is sensitive to __text-indent__ and __capital letters__.

__So be careful when you copy some query from anywhere!__

Insisting on using __4 space__ instead of using __TAB__


## Input&Output

### Print()

1. When you use comma in __Print()__, the comma will be presented as a blank space.

2. __Print()__ also can print an integer or a calculation.

### Input()

```Python
name = input()
name
```
## Data Type

###Integer
###Float
###String
You can use '' or "".

__"\\"__ is the escape character.

__"\\n"__ is a linefeed.

 __"\\t"__ is a vertical tab.

 __r''__ means that do not escape the content in the single quote.

 __'''...'''__ this is allowed to print multiple lines, if you don't want to use __"\n"__
 ```Python
 >>> print('''line1
 ... line2
 ... line3''')
 line1
 line2
 line3
 ```
 ###Boolean
 ###NoneType
 __None__ is the return value of functions that "don't return anything".
it is also a __common default return value__ for functions that search for something and may or may not find it.
 __None__ is not a "0" value.

##Variable

Variable should be the combination of __letters, number or "\_"__, but __cannot__ begin with numbers.

 ##Others

 "\\" double backslash: get the integer division result.

 "%" mod calculation.
